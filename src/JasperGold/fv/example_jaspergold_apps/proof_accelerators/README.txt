About the Proof Accelerator kits...
-----------------------------------

The kits in this directory provide opportunities to learn by
example. They include serial-to-parallel universal receiver verification with
the jasper_scoreboard_priority and jasper_scoreboard_2 Formal Scoreboard Proof
Accelerators



More about the example Formal Scoreboard Proof Accelerators...
--------------------------------------------------------------


  jasper_scoreboard_2
  -------------------

  The jasper_scoreboard Formal Scoreboard Proof Accelerator is an
  encrypted Verification Component that can be used to prove the
  integrity of data transfers across a design. The multiple input
  and output ports of these Proof Accelerators make it possible to
  verify many different types of data transfers, such as
  transfers relying on byte enables and bus-width conversion or
  serial-to-parallel conversion.


  jasper_scoreboard_priority
  --------------------------

  The jasper_scoreboard_priority Formal Scoreboard Proof
  Accelerator is an encrypted macro to prove the integrity of
  data packets or data beats transferred through the DUV where the
  priority for each packet can be different. This Proof
  Accelerator applies to designs such as bridges, queues, and
  FIFOs where it is critical to ensure no data is lost, corrupted,
  or duplicated during a transfer.
