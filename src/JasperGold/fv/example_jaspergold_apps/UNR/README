How to run:
==================
Note: Please ensure that jg path is set to 64bit installation.
1. source setup.csh
2. To run simulation : RUNME sim 
3. To run UNR in single step  : RUNME unr  
4. To analyse the data in IMC after running UNR : imc -exec jgproject/sessionLogs/session_0/unr_imc_coverage_merge.cmd

Expected Results:
================
A) After running simulation (step 2) , the Coverage % in IMC for the DUT uart_top = 78.47% 
B) UNR will generate AFA (block + expressions) for the 21.53% holes (251 items).   
C) After running UNR (step 3) , you will see 12 unreachable items. 
D) For excluding all the UNR uncomment the exclude line in jgproject/sessionLogs/session_0/unr_imc_coverage_merge.cmd
E) Save the excluded information in the refinement file using imc command : save -refinement abc.vRefine
F) To see the Coverage % in IMC after running UNR , load the saved refinement file in IMC.         
   Coverage % for DUT uart_top = 80.14% now.
